tutorial
========

Collection of tutorial projects from the Spring guides:

https://spring.io/guides

Each project has its own ReadMe with details on how to run.

All projects use Spring Boot to collect the jars on the class path and create a single executable jar with everything required to run the service.  Application configuration is managed by Java SpringConfig.  Gradle is used to build each project.
